class RadClass:
    '''
    Bulk handler class. Contains most functions needed for processing data
        stream files and pass along to an analysis object.

    Attributes:
    running: indicates whether the end of a file has been reached and thus end.
    stride: The number of seconds (which equals the number of indexes
        to advance after analyzing an integration interval. e.g. if
        stride = 3, then the next integration period will setp 3 seconds ahead.
        If stride = integration, all observations will be analyzed once.
    integration: The number of seconds (which equals the number of indexes)
        indexes) to integrate the spectrum over. e.g. if integration = 5, then
        the next 5 rows (corresponding to the next 5 seconds) of data will be
        pulled and summed/integrated to analyze.
    datapath: HDF5 group/subgroup path to dataset, including prefix,
        node ID, and analysis element. e.g. '/path/to/dataset'
    filename: The filename for the data to be analyzed.
    TODO: Make node and filename -lists- so that multiple nodes and files
        can be processed by the same object.
    store_data: boolean; if true, save the results to a CSV file.
    cache_size: (WIP) optional parameter to reduce file I/O and therefore
        increase performance. Indexes a larger selection of rows to analyze.
        If not provided (None), cache_size is ignored (equals integration).
    labels: list of dataset name labels in this order:
        [ live_label: live dataset name in HDF5 file,
          timestamps_label: timestamps dataset name in HDF5 file,
          spectra_label: spectra dataset name in HDF5 file ]
